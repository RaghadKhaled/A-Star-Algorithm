# A-Star-Algorithm

--- 

This is a project required for an Artificial Intelligence course during my BSc study.<br>
It is done as teamwork with my colleagues.

## Project overview

This project aims to implement an A* algorithm to solve the Route-Finding Problem for emergency exit. We formulated the problem and explained how to implement the A* algorithms from scratch, applied the A* algorithm on the problem, and compared between the performance of heuristics used.
 All details are in the notebook.
